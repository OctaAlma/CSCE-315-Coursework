            <h1>Haynes Recreational Center</h1>
            <p>During my senior year of high school I had the opportunity to volunteer at a local recreational center. During my time there, I was able to work with existing staff to organize activities for youth members of the center, such as Ping-Pong tournaments and basketball contests. I was also tasked with upkeeping the facility by wiping windows and brooming floors on a bi-weekly basis. I also volunteered as a receptionist, where I picked up calls and provided guidance to new and existing members. My exposure to members and staff of different ages and backgrounds helped me learn to adapt my tone and language to better my interactions.</p>

            <h1>Sister Cities Festival</h1>
            <p>For nearly two decades now, my hometown has organized and hosted an event where merchants from Central and South America are able to bring goods such as food, clothing, and traditional items from their respective cultures and hometowns. I volunteered to serve as a translator to help merchants sell their goods to non-Spanish speakers. I ended up helping out a family from San Luis Potosi that was selling handmade hats. They were extremely nice and were able to expose me to their family business, customs, and traditions.

            <h1>National Honor Society</h1>
            <p> I was nominated for my high school&rsquo;s National Honor Society chapter at the end of my junior year, and this enabled me to engage in several activities aiming to better our local community. One of the first events I participated in was tree-planting at a local park in Laredo, which ended up inspiring my senior-year capstone project. There were also frequent fundraisers and food drives to serve economically disadvantaged members of our community.
