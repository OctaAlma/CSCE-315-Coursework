                My name is Octavio Almanza, and I was born in Laredo, a small border city in south Texas between Mexico and the United States. I spent most of my childhood with my mother&#x2019s family in Mexico, which enabled me to adopt her culture, religion, and traditions. When I reached grade school, my mother decided to enroll me as a student in the US. Although this transition came with some personal hardships given the language and cultural barriers, my family knew it would be important for my future.
                <br><br>
                My introduction to computer science began with my 8th grade technology class. I was tasked with creating basic programs in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch&#8599</a>, which is a block-based, visual programming website aimed at younger audiences. I found myself spending much of my free time working on small projects on my middle school&#x2019s rental laptop, which consisted of small platformer games and recreations of classic arcade games. I recall proudly showing my finished projects to my family and how fulfilling it felt to see them in action. Although Scratch is extremely user-friendly and limited in scope, it exposed me to the many challenges and possibilities that came with programming. This experience would lead me to enter my high school&#x2019s robotics team and computer science track.
                <br><br>
                My experience as a programmer for the FIRST Robotics Competition enabled me to work with Java, explore the basics of object-oriented design, and how computers interact with external devices such as motors and controllers. Working with high-level abstractions and devices furthered my curiosity about how everything worked under the hood, and it solidified my decision to pursue the field for my undergraduate studies. 
                <br><br>
                As my high school graduation approached, I had a hard time deciding where I would continue my studies. Although I would have liked to stay in a community college near my family and friends, my parents convinced me to pursue any opportunities that arose. This is why upon receiving my acceptance letter to A&M, I decided to further my education away from home. My family has made many expenses and sacrifices to ensure I could follow my passions, and I will ensure nothing goes to waste by continuing to succeed in all my educational endeavors.
