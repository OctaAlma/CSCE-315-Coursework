                <p><strong><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition (2019-2020)&#8599</a></strong> - I had the opportunity to participate in my high school&rsquo;s FRC team, which introduced me to Java and, consequently, object-oriented programming. I utilized the libraries provided by FIRST and the electrical drivetrain to control the many motors throughout the robot. And although my position was with the programming team, I also had the chance to work with the engineers as well. They introduced me to the many aspects of computer-aided-design such as modeling, 3D printing, and CNC machining.

                <p><strong>Tree-Planting Robot Capstone Project (2019-2020)</strong> - In my senior year of high school, a friend and I decided to design a tree-planting robot for our Capstone project. Our idea was to create a robot that would autonomously plant saplings that were loaded onto it, and the goal was to deploy it in our hometown to help repopulate its deforested areas. This project exposed both of us the engineering design process and how a product changes as more research about the problem is conducted.

            <h1>Technical Interests</h1>

            <p>
                <strong>Software Engineering</strong> - Although the branch of software engineering is fairly broad, I have always been interested in the process in which larger-scale solutions are designed, developed, tested, and deployed throughout the industry. This branch is known for demanding collaboration within a team, which enables each member to focus on a particular aspect of the final solution. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Mobile Application Development</strong> - Given the rise of smartphones since the early 2010s, mobile applications are more important than ever before. There are so many useful tools and creative uses of the functionality offered by a modern smartphone, from online-ordering applications to Artificial Intelligence assistants. Today, many companies are relying on enterprise applications to communicate both internally and with clients, and I plan to pursue a career involving these solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> - As people entrust more and more of their sensitive information to corporations, applications, and banks, developments in the field of cybersecurity have become extremely important. I have seen family members become victims of identity theft and fraud as a result of data leaks. Because of this, I have decided to pursue cybersecurity for my minor and plan to learn more about network safety and vulnerability management.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Game Design</strong> - One of the primary reasons why I became interested in computer science was my curiosity regarding how my favorite childhood games were created. Game design is an art form that combines individual aspects of visualization, simulation, animation, and game theory, that are then creatively expressed with the help of software tools.
