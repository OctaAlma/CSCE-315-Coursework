Hints on the database

- Do not have a customer database, it just slows things down
	- You might want to keep the names of vendors
	- You might want a vendor for fresh vegetables for fresh plates and frozen chicke

- Transaction database
	- Be careful how this data is stored
	- Prices change over time, so you do not want to 
	- Will help 


Inventory
	- Realize that you may only need one slice of cheese for a burger, but you might buy inventory 
	- Do you keep track of how much coke you sell or how many liters? After all, people get free refills
